Our task management system project involves implementing a microservices architecture, which we have defined to comprise five core services: 
User Management, Task Creation, Task Assignment, Notifications, and Task Dashboard. To create this architecture, 
we started by setting up blank solutions for each service and adding common functionalities as building blocks. 
We also incorporated an API Gateway to facilitate communication between the services. Each microservice is containerized using Docker,
allowing for efficient deployment and scalability. Initially, we developed the User Management service, which handles user registration,
authentication, and profile management. Using minimal API, we implemented endpoints for user registration, login, and user profile,
laying the foundation for further development of the remaining microservices. By adopting a microservices approach, 
our system will be more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain, enabling us to deliver a robust and efficient task management solution.
